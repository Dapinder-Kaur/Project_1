Solved an issue:

using this website: https://medium.com/@cryptowikihere/resolving-permission-denied-public-key-error-in-visual-studio-code-and-git-13d11c7f608d#:~:text=Conclusion%3A,username%20during%20the%20initial%20push.
The issue was with pushing the changes in the very first commit.

- It was supposed to be: git push https://Dapinder-Kaur@github.com/Dapinder-Kaur/Project_1.git
(with my user name in the very first push so that gitHub recognizes me)
- Earlier I was using only git push -u origin main
